> **📦 Heads-up on repository size.** Freqtrade Ultimate ships a bundle of historical
> Hyperliquid OHLCV data (397 pairs × 8 timeframes, reaching further back than Hyperliquid's
> own 5000-candle API limit). It is one of the reasons the fork exists — but it makes a full
> clone **~6.5 GB**.
>
> Every `git clone` below therefore uses `--filter=blob:none`, which fetches file contents
> on demand instead of every historical revision. Measured on a fresh clone: **~2 GB in
> under a minute**, with the complete working tree — all the code *and* the 3358 data files.
>
> Want the code without the data bundle? A sparse checkout gets you there in
> **~130 MB, in seconds**:
>
> ```bash
> git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/titouannwtt/freqtrade-ultimate.git
> cd freqtrade-ultimate
> git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' '!user_data/data'
> ```

## 🔄 Already running freqtrade? Switch to Ultimate without losing anything

**Freqtrade Ultimate is a drop-in superset of upstream freqtrade.** Same `freqtrade` command, same configuration schema, same database format — it just adds features. Your bot *is* its `user_data/` folder (strategies, configs, hyperopt and backtest results, downloaded data) plus its trade database. Switching forks means pointing a Freqtrade Ultimate install at those same files. **Nothing about a running bot changes**: same open trades, same config, same strategy — it simply resumes with extra capabilities available.

<details>
<summary><b>Before you start (30-second checklist)</b></summary>

- **Stop the bot cleanly first** — let it finish its cycle (`Ctrl+C` in its screen/tmux, or `systemctl stop`). Don't migrate a bot mid-trade.
- **Back up your trade database and config** — `cp tradesv3.sqlite tradesv3.sqlite.bak`. Cheap insurance.
- **Database migrations are forward-only and automatic.** Ultimate tracks the current upstream version, so your DB upgrades itself on first start. (Only relevant edge case: don't point Ultimate at a DB written by a *newer* upstream `develop` than this fork — downgrading a DB is unsupported by freqtrade itself.)
- You don't need to uninstall your current freqtrade. The cleanest migrations below keep your old setup intact as an instant rollback.

</details>

### 🖥️ Native install (source / venv — no Docker)

The safest path is **non-destructive**: install the fork in a *new* folder and run your existing bot from it. Your old install is never touched, so rollback is "just start the old one again".

```bash
# 1. Stop your current bot cleanly (Ctrl+C in its screen/tmux, or `systemctl stop`).

# 2. Back up your trade database (cheap insurance).
cp /path/to/tradesv3.sqlite /path/to/tradesv3.sqlite.bak

# 3. Clone Freqtrade Ultimate into a NEW folder — your old install stays as rollback.
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/titouannwtt/freqtrade-ultimate.git
#   ↑ ~6.5 GB of bundled Hyperliquid market data lives in this repo's history.
#     --filter=blob:none fetches file contents on demand: same working tree,
#     a fraction of the download. Drop the flag if you want the full history.
cd freqtrade-ultimate

# 4. Install it (creates its own .venv; your old environment is untouched).
./setup.sh -i

# 5. Activate and confirm you're on the fork.
source .venv/bin/activate
freqtrade --version

# 6. Run YOUR bot with YOUR existing files — nothing copied, nothing lost.
freqtrade trade \
  --config   /path/to/your/config.json \
  --strategy YourStrategy \
  --userdir  /path/to/your/user_data \
  --db-url   sqlite:////absolute/path/to/your/tradesv3.sqlite
```

> **Prefer one tidy folder?** Instead of pointing at old paths, copy your data into the clone:
> `cp -a /path/to/your/user_data/. ./user_data/` then place your `config.json` and `*.sqlite` where you normally keep them, and launch as usual.

### 🐳 Docker

There is **no public Ultimate image — you build it yourself from source** (the repo's `.dockerignore` excludes the bundled data, so the build stays small and fast). Recommended path: keep your working `docker-compose.yml`, volumes and DB exactly as they are, and **swap only the image**.

```bash
# 1. Stop your current stack.
docker compose down

# 2. Build the Freqtrade Ultimate image from source.
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/titouannwtt/freqtrade-ultimate.git
#   ↑ ~6.5 GB of bundled Hyperliquid market data lives in this repo's history.
#     --filter=blob:none fetches file contents on demand: same working tree,
#     a fraction of the download. Drop the flag if you want the full history.
cd freqtrade-ultimate
docker build -t freqtrade-ultimate:latest .
cd -

# 3. In your EXISTING docker-compose.yml, change the image line:
#       image: freqtradeorg/freqtrade:stable
#    to:
#       image: freqtrade-ultimate:latest

# 4. Bring the bot back up — same mounted user_data, same DB, same trades.
docker compose up -d
```

> Your `user_data/` volume and database are never rewritten by this — only the code inside the container changes. **Rollback:** set the image line back to `freqtradeorg/freqtrade:stable` and `docker compose up -d`.
> **Update the fork later:** `git pull` in the clone → `docker build -t freqtrade-ultimate:latest .` → `docker compose up -d`.

<details>
<summary><b>Windows users</b></summary>

`setup.sh` is for macOS/Linux. On Windows, use the **Docker** path above, or install inside **WSL2** and follow the native path there.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Staying in sync with upstream</b></summary>

This fork keeps the official project as its `upstream` remote and merges upstream releases in, so you keep getting upstream fixes on top of the Ultimate features. To pull the latest fork code: `git pull` (native) or `git pull` + rebuild (Docker), then restart your bot.

</details>

## 🌱 New to freqtrade? Start here

You don't need to install upstream freqtrade first — Freqtrade Ultimate is a complete, ready-to-run installation on its own.

> 🇫🇷 **Francophone ?** La communauté **Freqtrade France** propose un guide écrit pas-à-pas (installation, configuration, premier bot) : **[Freqtrade — le guide complet du bot de trading open source](https://buymeacoffee.com/freqtrade_france/freqtrade-le-guide-complet-du-bot-de-trading-open-source-installation-et-config)**. *(French only / en français uniquement.)*

### 🖥️ Native install (source / venv)

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/titouannwtt/freqtrade-ultimate.git
#   ↑ ~6.5 GB of bundled Hyperliquid market data lives in this repo's history.
#     --filter=blob:none fetches file contents on demand: same working tree,
#     a fraction of the download. Drop the flag if you want the full history.
cd freqtrade-ultimate
./setup.sh -i

source .venv/bin/activate
freqtrade create-userdir --userdir user_data
freqtrade new-config --config user_data/config.json
```

### 🐳 Docker

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` builds the Ultimate image for you (tagged `freqtrade-ultimate:latest`):

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/titouannwtt/freqtrade-ultimate.git
#   ↑ ~6.5 GB of bundled Hyperliquid market data lives in this repo's history.
#     --filter=blob:none fetches file contents on demand: same working tree,
#     a fraction of the download. Drop the flag if you want the full history.
cd freqtrade-ultimate

# Build the image from source.
docker compose build

# Create your user_data folder and a starter config:
docker compose run --rm freqtrade create-userdir --userdir user_data
docker compose run --rm freqtrade new-config --config user_data/config.json

# Edit user_data/config.json (exchange, stake, pairs), then launch:
docker compose up -d
```

**Next steps:** edit `user_data/config.json` (exchange, stake, pairs), drop a strategy into `user_data/strategies/`, then launch with `freqtrade trade` (native) or `docker compose up -d`. The full [Freqtrade documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/) applies unchanged; see the [Learn](#-learn-algorithmic-trading) section below and [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) for what this fork adds.

## 🎯 What is Freqtrade Ultimate?

A maintained, opinionated fork of [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) optimized for serious algorithmic trading on **Hyperliquid** perpetual futures, with **32+ features** not present upstream.

**Why this fork exists.** Running multiple Freqtrade bots in production on Hyperliquid surfaces real-world problems upstream wasn't designed for — rate-limit cascades when four bots refresh OHLCV simultaneously, ADL and liquidation handling on a DEX without traditional liquidation events, multi-bot pairlist deduplication, and statistically valid hyperopt without curve-fitting. This fork solves those.

**Architecture at a glance.** [`docs/diagrams/`](docs/diagrams/README.md) has three
interactive diagrams (system architecture, the `ftcache` fetch sequence, and the bot loop with
its Hyperliquid safety branches) — download any `.html` file and open it in a browser.

**Editorial principle: no curve-fitted strategies.** Every showcase strategy in this repo ships with its walk-forward analysis and real drawdowns. We do not promote backtest-pretty strategies that fail live — many popular Freqtrade strategies embed subtle lookahead biases that make backtests look magical and live results disappointing. We document why, and we publish the methodology that avoids it.

## ⚡ Feature highlights

A quick tour. Full inventory with implementation details lives in [**docs/FEATURES.md**](docs/FEATURES.md).

### Multi-bot infrastructure
- **OHLCV Cache Daemon (`ftcache`)** — Shared candle cache across N bots, **75 % API call reduction** measured in production with four bots.
- **Pairlist Cache Daemon (`ftpairlists`)** — Deduplicates pairlist filter computation between bots (pairlist refresh: 15 min → 3 min).
- **Position Guard + Leverage Sync** — Prevents conflicting entries and unintended hedges on shared wallets.
- **Fleet State Notifications + Auto-Restart** — Thundering-herd prevention with startup jitter, `launch_bot.sh` auto-restart loop.
- **Position reconciliation & safe retirement** *(optional)* — `reconcile_positions.py` detects orphan/phantom positions on a netted wallet; `retire_bot.py` cuts a bot without leaving an orphan (force-exit before stop). See [docs/fleet-reconciliation.md](docs/fleet-reconciliation.md). Everything works without them.

### Hyperopt & validation
- **PlateauSampler** — Coordinate-wise Optuna sampler for robust hyperparameter optimization (four-phase: baseline → scan → assembly → refinement).
- **`--sampler` CLI flag** — Switch between TPE, NSGA-II/III, CMA-ES, GP, QMC samplers without editing your strategy code.
- **Walk-Forward Analysis** (`freqtrade walk-forward`) — Rolling, anchored, and **CPCV (Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation)** modes, plus Monte Carlo drawdown simulation, **PBO (Probability of Backtest Overfitting)** score, verdict A–F, and an interactive HTML report.
- **Custom hyperopt losses** — `MoutonMeanRevHyperOptLoss` (mean-reversion / DCA), `MoutonMomentumHyperOptLoss` (trend / momentum), `WalkForwardLoss` (multi-window robustness — rejects single-regime overfits), `MyProfitDrawDownHyperOptLoss` (simple baseline).

### Hyperliquid-specific
- **Liquidation detection** via user-fills monitoring (`liquidationMarkPx`).
- **External close detection** (ADL or manual UI close) with `exit_reason="external_close"`.
- **Resilient leverage / margin error handling** in DCA continues operation instead of crashing.
- **Local Hyperliquid historical data bundle** — 3 250+ Feather files (300+ pairs × 8 timeframes including crypto indices and TradFi perpetuals).

### Position integrity (multi-bot / shared account)
- **Provable order ownership** — every order carries a per-bot client order id, so a bot on a shared wallet can recover *its own* lost orders without ever claiming a sibling's.
- **Guards around every order** — an external close requires a positions view newer than the trade's own fill; exits are capped at what the wallet holds; the position arithmetic is asserted after each fill.
- **`freqtrade position-audit`** — dated attestation of exchange vs. every bot's book, with an append-only hash-chained ledger and a break register that ages each discrepancy until it is resolved. Read-only; exits non-zero on drift. See [docs/position-audit.md](docs/position-audit.md).
- **Automatic bot logs** — a live/dry bot gets a rotating logfile without configuration.
- **`user_data/bench_dashboard.py`** — measures what a dashboard page load costs the whole fleet (wall time, tail latency, payload per endpoint) and diffs two runs, so a performance claim can be checked rather than believed. See [docs/fleet-snapshot.md](docs/fleet-snapshot.md).

### Pairlists & risk
- **`TrendRegularityFilter`** — Excludes pairs with a regular linear uptrend (essential for short strategies).
- **`backtest_lock_wallet`** — Disables compounding in backtests for honest equity curves.
- **Capital withdrawal accounting** — Tracks net profit after capital removal in REST API, Telegram and `/profit`.

### Observability
- **`ExchangeMetrics`** — Ring-buffered API-call metrics, 429 tracking, live token-bucket state.
- **REST API enriched** — `/cache_status`, `/rate_metrics`, `/fleet/status`, `/fleet/events`, `/volume_history`, `/signal_summary`, `/stratdev/*` (consumed by [frequi-ultimate](https://github.com/titouannwtt/frequi-ultimate)).
- **Enhanced Telegram** — `LIQUIDATION` and `external_close` exit reasons; withdrawal-aware `/profit`.

### Dry-run replay
- **Replay engine** — Drives `FreqtradeBot.process()` (the real live code path) candle-by-candle over historical data via a virtual clock and fake exchange overlay. **Validate a strategy in hours instead of months.**
- **1-minute resolution, real funding** — Stoploss/ROI/signals checked every virtual minute; funding computed from local Feather files. Equivalent to permanent `--timeframe-detail 1m` on the real engine.
- **Config auto-launch** — Add a `dry_run_replay` block to your bot config and the bot auto-seeds a 5-month replay on first start, then transitions to normal dry-run. Zero manual action.
- **Coordinator daemon** — Caps concurrent replays to `nproc - 2 - hyperopt_cores` with SIGSTOP/SIGCONT priority queue. Auto-spawned.

### Developer experience
- **Strategy Dev Backend** — Reader, jobs runner, strategy editor APIs (consumed by [frequi-ultimate](https://github.com/titouannwtt/frequi-ultimate)).
- **AI Copilot** — Repository ships with [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) plus 14 tip files containing 199 trading rules curated from Carver, Clenow, Chan, López de Prado, and the Freqtrade France community.
- **Enhanced CLI help** — Practical guidance, recommendations, and tradeoffs documented in every option.

## 📊 Showcase strategies

This repository ships with public showcase strategies directly inside [`user_data/strategies/`](user_data/strategies/). Each strategy follows a strict naming convention:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<strategy>.py` | Strategy code (production-grade) |
| `<strategy>_readme.md` | Philosophy, indicators, entry/exit logic, recommended config snippet |
| `<strategy>_analysis.md` | Backtest results, walk-forward verdict, drawdown analysis, PBO score |
| `<strategy>.json` | Optimized hyperopt parameters |

These strategies are intentionally simple and **honest about their limits**. They demonstrate the methodology (anti-overfitting, walk-forward, real drawdowns), not maximum profitability. **More advanced and live-tested strategies are reserved for [Freqtrade France](https://buymeacoffee.com/freqtrade_france) members** along with full live PnL screenshots and reproducible parameters.

## 🎛️ The dashboard: FreqUI Ultimate

Freqtrade Ultimate pairs with **[FreqUI Ultimate](https://github.com/titouannwtt/frequi-ultimate)**, a ground-up redesign of the Freqtrade dashboard built for **monitoring a fleet of bots at once**. Where stock FreqUI shows one bot on a plain table, FreqUI Ultimate gives you a glassmorphism multi-bot command center: side-by-side bot comparison, live equity vs BTC benchmark, market regime context, portfolio-wide risk, and 13 cross-bot alert types.

> 🔗 **Why it belongs here:** FreqUI Ultimate's advanced widgets (Risk Overview, Market Pulse, fleet comparison, volume/signal context, the in-browser strategy editor) are driven by **REST endpoints that only exist in Freqtrade Ultimate** — `/fleet/status`, `/fleet/events`, `/rate_metrics`, `/cache_status`, `/volume_history`, `/signal_summary`, `/stratdev/*`. Point the same UI at a stock freqtrade bot and those panels stay empty. **The full experience requires this fork as the backend.**

### The multi-bot dashboard

A single screen for your whole fleet: live log console, cumulative profit vs BTC benchmark, per-bot comparison table (open/closed P&L, win/loss, monthly profit, DCA escalations), and every open position with duration-health bars.

### Fleet comparison & alerts

Compare every bot head-to-head — custom columns, tags, filters, groups, drag-drop ordering, CSV export, and **13 cross-bot alert types** that flag anomalies across the whole fleet at a glance.

<img width="2538" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a32c3d8-1501-4ba0-81a1-c3a3d22d0262" />


### Market Pulse & portfolio Risk Overview

Context stock FreqUI never surfaces: BTC dominance, Fear & Greed, your fleet's performance vs BTC/ETH on the left — and on the right, portfolio-wide exposure, net/gross/long-short split, average leverage, largest position, worst drawdown, and correlation warnings.

<img width="848" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deef75ef-80da-4c28-a046-0c802604ce3c" />


### Analytics widgets

Per-bot profit benchmarks, performance heatmap, activity timeline, and a Monte-Carlo stress test — the analytical depth a serious multi-bot operator needs.
<img width="848" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4c6e52c-c99b-4279-a51f-c52dcb7c5285" />
