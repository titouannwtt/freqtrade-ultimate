"""
Fleet position coordination (fork extension).

Lets several bots that share the same wallet / dry-run group avoid stacking
positions on the same pair, and lets them reconcile leverage when they do.

Coordination source of truth is the *trade database of sibling bots* in the
same environment. The exchange is only used as a non-blocking final cross-check
(a spot balance does not necessarily map to an open trade, so it cannot be
authoritative).

What counts as a sibling is controlled by ``position_coordination.scope``:

* ``wallet``   — (default) only bots trading the *same wallet/account* on the
                 exchange coordinate. Bots split across distinct wallets of the
                 same exchange (separate API keys / wallet addresses,
                 sub-accounts, or several accounts) stay independent. Wallet
                 identity is auto-detected from the credentials already in the
                 config (Hyperliquid wallet address or API key), or set
                 explicitly with ``position_coordination.account``.
* ``exchange`` — every bot on the exchange (same ``dry_run``) coordinates,
                 regardless of wallet (fleet-wide "one position per coin").

Three modes (config key ``position_coordination.mode``):

* ``off``    — no coordination (upstream behaviour).
* ``compat`` — a pair may be shared only if the existing sibling position is on
               the *same side*; leverage is reconciled per ``leverage_policy``
               (``lowest`` / ``highest`` / ``keep`` / ``block`` / ``cap``). The
               ``cap`` policy adopts the coin's leverage only when it is at most
               what this bot asked for, and blocks the entry when the coin already
               sits higher — so a low/no-leverage strategy can never inherit a
               higher leverage from a more aggressive sibling on a shared wallet.
* ``strict`` — a pair already held by a sibling can never be entered.

``position_coordination.never_block_entries`` (bool, per bot) keeps all of the above
running — sibling discovery, the per-pair lock, intent markers, the exchange
cross-check — but downgrades every refusal to an allow, at the leverage the coin
already carries and without ever changing it. The suppressed refusal is reported on
the ``Decision`` (``overridden`` / ``blocked_reason``) and logged, so a bot whose
signals are too rare to afford a missed entry can trade through the shared wallet
while the cost of doing so stays measurable.

An ``flock`` + short-lived *intent marker* serialises concurrent entries on the
same (group, pair) so two bots cannot both pass the check on the same candle
close (first to acquire the lock wins).
